## Tuesday opgaver

JpaDemo project is in the folder called 01_tuesday. I have completed all of the exercises.

## The person project (Wednesday-thursday)

The project is in the folder called 02_wednesday.

I have completed everything from part 1.
I completed the errors from part 2 but I don't think i use it correctly. I am missing the last part with input errors.
I have done part 3 and put in relations but I did not complete the last part with the ManyToOne on Addresses.

In general my test were failing but i tried to make them as I wanted to and commet them out.

If you want to run the code use the Tester.java in the Untils folder or just run the test.
